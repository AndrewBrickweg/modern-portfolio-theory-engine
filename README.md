Project Overview

This repository contains the latest version of GoFiNet, a Go-based financial analysis application originally developed collaboratively. The project provides stock data retrieval, user authentication, and backend infrastructure for financial modeling.

This repository represents the continuation and extension of that work, with added focus on portfolio optimization using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).

Separation of Work

To clearly document contribution history:

My Contributions (Andrew Brickweg)

Designed and built the frontend interface.

Implemented the API integration layer connecting frontend requests with backend services(Global Search, Login Auth, Alphavantage API Calls).

Extended the system to incorporate Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) for portfolio optimization and risk-adjusted allocation.


Peer Contributions (Original Repository Collaborator: Ethan Long)

Implemented the core backend architecture, including:

Authentication system

Session management

Database schema and access layers

Stock-data ingestion and processing

Server routing and core Go infrastructure

Current Goal

This repository serves as the independent continuation of the original project, focusing on integrating MPT to provide users with optimized portfolio recommendations based on covariance, expected returns, and risk preferences.
